puts "The string '#{string}' is nonempty." unless string.empty?

('a'..'z').to_a.shuffle.join[0..7]

(1..5).each do |number|
  puts 2 * number
  puts '=='
end

As with arrays and ranges, hashes respond to the each method. For example, consider a hash named flash with keys for two conditions, :success and :error:

Note that, while the each method for arrays takes a block with only one variable, each for hashes takes two, a key and a value. Thus, the each method for a hash iterates through the hash one key-value pair at a time.

The last example uses the useful inspect method, which returns a string with a literal representation of the object it’s called on:

puts (1..5).to_a
puts (1..5).to_a.inspect

puts "It is working!", "It worked!".inspect

By the way, using inspect to print an object is common enough that there’s a shortcut for it, the p function

p :username


HTML5 adds the header, nav, and section elements for divisions common to many applications. All HTML elements, including divs and the new HTML5 elements, can be assigned classes2 and ids; these are merely labels, and are useful for styling with CSS (Section 5.1.2). The main difference between classes and ids is that classes can be used multiple times on a page, but ids can only be used once.
