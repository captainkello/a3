puts "The string '#{string}' is nonempty." unless string.empty?

('a'..'z').to_a.shuffle.join[0..7]

(1..5).each do |number|
  puts 2 * number
  puts '=='
end

As with arrays and ranges, hashes respond to the each method. For example, consider a hash named flash with keys for two conditions, :success and :error:

Note that, while the each method for arrays takes a block with only one variable, each for hashes takes two, a key and a value. Thus, the each method for a hash iterates through the hash one key-value pair at a time.

The last example uses the useful inspect method, which returns a string with a literal representation of the object itâ€™s called on:

puts (1..5).to_a
puts (1..5).to_a.inspect

puts "It is working!", "It worked!".inspect
